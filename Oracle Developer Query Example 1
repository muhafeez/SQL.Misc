--Here is a SQL query that I have written to pull date of birth of all employees reporting to a manager who's last name is Smith. 

SELECT DISTINCT

e.emplid "Perm EmpID"

, e.emp_name "Employee Name"

, e.BIRTH_DT "Employee Birthday"

FROM

hcm_d_emp e

INNER JOIN hcm_f_job j ON j.d_emplid = e.d_emplid

INNER JOIN hcm_d_empl_class ec ON j.d_empl_class = ec.d_empl_class

INNER JOIN hcm_d_supv_snap ss ON ss.d_supv = j.d_supv AND ss.d_period = j.d_period

INNER JOIN hcm_d_emp e2 ON e2.emplid = ss.supid_lvl3

WHERE

e.d_type = 2

AND j.active = 1

AND ec.empl_class = 'EMP' /* Only get the employee row */

AND ss.supname_lvl3 like '%Smith%'

and TO_DATE(sysdate) BETWEEN j.start_effdt AND j.end_effdt
